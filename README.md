# What-Kind-of-Gamer-Are-You?
Steam Web App to tell you what kind of gamer you are!

### Notes:

Coming up with an idea using Steam API was unusually difficult because steam market bots and steamdb encompass almost
everything you would want or need.

People get confused between user-defined tags and genre. User-defined tags are not accessible and are not the best
use considering they are community-defined which lead to questionable naming conventions.

API is publicly available but there is nil documentation provided by Valve on it. Hence they expect the developers to 
read the source code themselves or rely on crowdsourced documentation.
