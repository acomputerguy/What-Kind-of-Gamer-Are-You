# What-Kind-of-Gamer-Are-You?
Steam Web App to tell you what kind of gamer you are!

### Notes:

Coming up with an idea using Steam API was unusually difficult because steam market bots and steamdb encompass almost

People get confused between user-defined tags and genre. User-defined tags are not accessible and are not the best
use considering they are community-defined which lead to questionable naming conventions.
